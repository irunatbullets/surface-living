This file contains short, high-level summaries of each release. For full details, including mod diffs, see the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/irunatbullets/surface-living/releases) page.

## [1.2.2]

Fixed neoforge version. Sorry everyone!

## [1.2.1]

Just some boring old updates... Plus, I fixed the server pack (which you can find in the releases on github)

## [1.2.0]

Added Not Just Mushrooms so you can decorate our house with cute mushrooms lamps!

## [1.1.0]

Added some recipes to give phantoms a reason to exist beyond just being annoying. Added some more structures and  a second overworld, because sometimes one isn't enough! For now we're sticking with vanilla Nether and End, but might look at other options later. Have fun!

## [1.0.0]

A fresh version of **Surface Living** is out.
