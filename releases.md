# Surface Living - Release Summary

This file contains short, high-level summaries of each release. For full details, including mod diffs, see the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/irunatbullets/surface-living/releases) page.

## [1.1.0]

Added some recipes to give phantoms a reason to exist beyond just being annoying. Added some more structures and  a second overworld, because sometimes one isn't enough! For now we're sticking with vanilla Nether and End, but might look at other options later. Have fun!

## [1.0.0]

A fresh version of **Surface Living** is out.
